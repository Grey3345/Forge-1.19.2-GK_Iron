This stuff is found in the world, in chunks close to the surface, they represent asteroids long ago that? 
Also didn't want to mess with base iron to much, aslo it has ugly texture.

sandpaper          Cleans rust off and Wax        Will see maybe add this to copper cleaning?
Flint n steel      Will just take wax off

The doors and Trap doors Does not require redstone.

Heating the metal mechanic. for Wrought iron and Refined Wrought iron
When placed above lava instead of rusting it can heat up a level(3 levels up just like rust or oxidation)
Each one turning the metal more glowy red color, and each level increases damage they do when coming into contact with it like magma blocks?
Over time they will slowly return back to there original metal just like if it's rusting or oxidation, and then it can start to rust again.
You can throw some chemical on the heated blocks to keep them in that state(will need a good solution to this) and then to clean it off.(wire brush)

Wrought Iron Grit or Gravel? (that can rust)(that can heatup) Will have gravity like gravel but will be metal.
If slime is rightclick on it(removes the gravity) If waterbottle is rightclicked on it(adds the gravity back) cleans off the slime? consumes the water not the bottle.

Weight block(custom model). Whatever block you place this block on, will give it gravity and push it down.

slag          You get from refining?
In order to refine, you need Vanilla Blast furnace.

Find that random guy who made the random iron texture and give credit/ask permission unless you change textures.
