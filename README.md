Raw wrought iron_______________________________
Raw wrought iron 		block

This stuff is found in the world, in chunks close to the surface, they represent asteroids long ago that? 
Also didn't want to mess with base iron to much, aslo it has ugly texture.

Black Painted Trimmed Wrought Iron	  Block/Stairs/Slab/wall/bars/beams/door/trapdoor
Fence 					  flat/spike/fancy
Fence gate 				flat/spike/fancy

sandpaper          Cleans rust off and Wax        Will see maybe add this to copper cleaning?
Flint n steel      Will just take wax off
Sand dust          Has a chance to drop this along side when breaking sandblocks 

The doors and Trap doors Does not require redstone.

Heated block stage 1 damage = Same as magma block damage 
Heated block stage 2 damage = Twice as much damage as magma block
Heated block stage 3 damage = Three times as much damage as magma block
Heating the metal mechanic. for Wrought iron and Refined Wrought iron
When placed above lava instead of rusting it can heat up a level(3 levels up just like rust or oxidation)
Each one turning the metal more glowy red color, and each level increases damage they do when coming into contact with it like magma blocks?
Over time they will slowly return back to there original metal just like if it's rusting or oxidation, and then it can start to rust again.
You can throw some chemical(sand dust) on the heated blocks to keep them in that state(will need a good solution to this) and then to clean it off.(wire brush)

Wrought Iron Grit or Gravel? (that can rust)(that can heatup) Will have gravity like gravel but will be metal.
If slime is rightclick on it(removes the gravity) If waterbottle is rightclicked on it(adds the gravity back) cleans off the slime? consumes the water not the bottle.

Weight block(custom model). Whatever block you place this block on, will give it gravity and push it down.

slag          You get from refining? 50% chance.
In order to refine, you need Vanilla Blast furnace.

World generation in chunks of like 12-16 blocks roundish, can generate any level above deepslate but if exposed to air random the rust on it.
About as common as iron in terms of each spawn. Obviously it has 12-16 so it will naturally be more common.


THESE ARE FOR LATER.
Found immersive weathering to add rust on iron, might need to have addon for that mod to add features from this mod.
Vanilla iron
Iron fence				squarewiremesh / chainlink / barbwire etc
Iron Beams				
Rusted varients 1/4 
Waxed varients for all
Iron Cable
THESE ARE FOR LATER.

Give credit to ordanarymods which is the rustable iron texture used (If I use it) They are now immersive weathering.

Find that random guy who made the random iron texture and give credit/ask permission unless you change textures.
