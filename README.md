sandpaper          Cleans rust off and Wax        Will see maybe add this to copper cleaning?
Flint n steel      Will just take wax off

The doors and Trap doors Does not require redstone.

----Maybe
Heating the metal mechanic. for Wrought iron and Refined Wrought iron
When placed above lava instead of rusting it can heat up a level(3 levels up just like rust or oxidation)
Each one turning the metal more glowy red color, and each level increases damage they do when coming into contact with it like magma blocks?
Over time they will slowly return back to there original metal just like if it's rusting or oxidation, and then it can start to rust again.
You can throw some chemical on the heated blocks to keep them in that state(will need a good solution to this) and then to clean it off.

Wrought Iron Grit? or Gravel? pebbles? of some kind to have a gravity metal block if not the main one?
Or maybe states if you apply slime to the block it does not have gravity? 
Maybe come up with something better

Fun Block, Weight block. Whatever block you place this block on will give it gravity and push it down.

Tool to pick them up? tongs?

slag          You get from refining?

Refined Wrought Iron 			Pressure pad/button
Refined Wrought Iron			Metal sign, only show text when redstone applied.
